# Hibernate Project

This project is a Java-based application designed to explore and demonstrate the core principles of Hibernate, focusing on the following key concepts:
- Manual learning of Hibernate.
- Understanding the detailed principles of transactions.
- Understanding `SessionFactory` and `Session`.

---

## ðŸ“– About the Project

Hibernate is a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for Java, enabling developers to interact with databases using object-oriented programming principles. This project serves as a guide for anyone interested in understanding Hibernate through practical implementation.

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Demonstrates how to create, read, update, and delete entities using Hibernate.
- **Transactions**: Explores the lifecycle of database transactions and how Hibernate manages them.
- **SessionFactory and Session**: Illustrates the roles and purposes of `SessionFactory` and `Session` in Hibernate.

## âœ¨ Key Concepts

### 1. **Transactions**
   - Transactions are fundamental in ensuring data consistency and integrity in Hibernate.
   - Hibernate wraps database interactions in transactions to handle them safely.
   - Code Example:
     ```java
     Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
     Transaction transaction = null;
     try {
         transaction = session.beginTransaction();
         // Perform database operations
         transaction.commit();
     } catch (Exception e) {
         if (transaction != null) transaction.rollback();
         e.printStackTrace();
     } finally {
         session.close();
     }
     ```

### 2. **SessionFactory**
   - The `SessionFactory` is a heavyweight object responsible for creating `Session` instances.
   - It is initialized once during the application startup and should be reused across the application.
   - Configuration is typically done through `hibernate.cfg.xml`.

### 3. **Session**
   - The `Session` represents a single-threaded unit of work with the database.
   - It provides methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects.
   - Sessions are short-lived and must be closed after usage.
